## About The Project

DePoop is a revolutionary dApp that tracks poop data while rewarding users with native tokens for logging their poops. It promotes both fun and hygiene awareness by allowing users to track their poop locations and contribute to a public map that highlights available poop-friendly spots.

## How It Works 🔧

Log Your Poop 💩 – Users submit poop logs through the DePoop app.

Verify Location 📍 – The app records the latitude & longitude of the poop.

Earn Rewards 🎉 – Users receive native tokens as incentives.

Public Contribution 🌍 – Locations with public access can be displayed on a community map to help others find available spots.

## Blockchain & ZK Integration 🔗

DePoop leverages on-chain transactions and zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) for private and verifiable logging.
